				During this experimental study, you will have the opportunity to develop your knowledge in statistics. You will be provided with a series of documents that you can explore freely (part of a university course). There is no ideal way of exploring the documents, as it depends on your prior kn<span id="highlighted" style="background-color:#FFFF00">owledge and learning habits.<br><br>
				After 20 minutes of exploration, you will be automatically b</span>rought to a quiz to evaluate your understanding on the explored topic. After again 5 minutes, you will be automatically brought to a short demographic form. Validating this form will end the experiment.<br><br>
				Each document will follow the exact same structure, allowing you to navigate between sections and documents. Please click on below sections to display them, read them, and pass a test quiz on your understanding of the instructions.<br><br>
				At the bottom of every page, a progress bar will help you keep track of the remaining time. Whenever you feel ready to explore the documents, you can click on the "Documents" button.

				Each screen corresponds to a single document, and the course is composed of several documents. In addition to hyperlinks between documents, you can also access the full list of documents (including the "Instructions" page you are currently reading) by clicking on the "Documents" button present on each document page.<br><br>
				Each document is made of 4 sections (panels), which cannot be seen simultaneously. To display a section and hide the others, simply click on the chosen section title. Documents will always adopt the following structure:
				<ul>
					<li><i>Introduction</i>: This section summarizes the content of page and provides the essential information on the associated topic.</li>
					<li><i>Details</i>: This section provides details on the method, and may be required to fully master the concept or method associated to the page. All provided information may not be needed to correctly answer the quizzes, but a thorough understanding may certainly help.</li>
					<li><i>Warnings</i>: This section is dedicated to avoiding confusion between similar concepts, or to provide the required precautions/conditions for applying a method or using a concept.</li>
					<li><i>Quiz</i>: This section displays a training multiple-choice question test. Such quizzes will not be taken into account to evaluate your performance (only the final quiz will be). One question at a time is displayed, with a single correct answer for each question. After selecting the desired answer, you may "submit" it to know if your answer was right or wrong, with as many trials as required. Once you find the correct answer, you can turn to the following question. Once the quiz is finished, you can start over (with the same questions) by clicking on the "Retake the quiz" link.</li>
				</ul>
				After the 20 minutes have elapsed, you will be brought to the final quiz, which will be similar to those found on the different document pages. Yet, new questions relating to possibly all documents will be displayed at once, and you will not get any feedback for an incorrect selection. You can leave unanswered questions if you want.<br><br>
				After 5 minutes on the final quiz or if you click on the "submit" button, you will be brought to the demographic form, to fill in carefully.<br><br>
				At any time during the experiment, a progress bar will be visible at the bottom of the screen. It will be filled at regular intervals, every fourth of the total time allocated for the current part of the experiment (5/20 minutes for the exploration, 75 seconds / 5 minutes for the final quiz). To avoid disturbing your reading or thinking, the bar will not be updated continuously.

				During the initial exploration of the documents (for 20 minutes), the progress bar at the bottom of every page will be updated every 5 minutes to help you keep track of the remaining time. Once the bar is full, you will only have a few more seconds before being brought to the final quiz, without any possibility to come back to the documents. This is not true for the small quizzes on each page, for which you can try as many times as you want, and navigate between sections and documents while you take the quiz.<br><br>
				Again, during the final quiz, the bar will be updated every 75 seconds (one fourth of the total quiz time of 5 minutes). Once the bar is full, you will only have a few more seconds before being brought to the demographic form, without any possibility to come back to the quiz, documents, as well as to change or complete your answers. Also, and contrary to the training quizzes which only deal with the content of a single document, the final quiz may reference all documents (except for the instructions).<br><br>
				For the demographic form, please fill in all fields if possible, as these are required to correctly analyse the collected data, and later use the results to improve educational platforms.
